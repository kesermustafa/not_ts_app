<h1>My Note Application - Typescript </h1>

This application is a modern note application that allows you to manage your notes in an organized and effective way. Users can easily create notes by adding titles, tags, and content to their notes or edit or delete existing notes. The content of the notes can be enriched using various markdown features such as titles, lists, and code blocks. Multiple tags can be added to notes, and notes can be easily categorized with these tags. Users can quickly reach the note they are looking for by filtering notes by title, tag, or both.

While TypeScript increases code quality with its powerful type system and advanced tool support, we created a high-performance and flexible user interface with React (Vite). We facilitated navigation within the application with React Router Dom and enabled users to easily add tags to their notes with the React-Select component. Thanks to React-Markdown, the content of the notes can be edited in rich text format, and we achieved a modern and responsive design with React-Bootstrap. We increased the reusability of the code by creating custom hooks with the UseHooks library and assigning a unique ID to each note with UUID.
